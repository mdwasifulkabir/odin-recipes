    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken fajitas are an easy and flavorful weeknight meal. A classic Mexican 
        recipe, juicy chicken is seasoned, seared and cooked to perfection, then tossed 
        with sauteed bell peppers and onions. A squeeze of fresh lime adds a punch of flavor 
        and the chicken fajitas are served with warm tortillas and toppings. You can’t beat
         this healthy family favorite recipe.</p>
        
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>While you can buy pre-made seasoning packets, I’d caution against it.
         Nothing compares to the flavor of homemade fajita seasoning and it’s 
         easy to whip up. Plus, you’ll avoid any unnecessary fillers and additives.
          Here’s a quick rundown of the spices you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides 
            of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it
            with a drizzle of olive oil or avocado oil. Sear the chicken breasts for about 
            7-8 minutes on each side. Then remove them from the pan and let them rest for 
            a few minutes before slicing into strips.</li>
        <li>Saute the bell peppers and onion. While the chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers
            and onions into thin slices. Then saute them in the same skillet over medium heat 
            for a few minutes until caramelized. You’re essentially making fajita veggies.</li>
        <li>Mix together. Add the chicken back into the skillet, squeeze fresh lime juice on
            top and stir everything together.</li>
        <li>Wrap it up. Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings.</li>
    </ol>
